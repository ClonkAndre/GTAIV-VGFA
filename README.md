# GTAIV-VGFA
Niko should originally be able to play video games with his friends.
This feature was cut but, there are still some voice lines left from Niko, Roman, Brucie and Dwayne. So i decided to bring this feature back. IN GTA IV, when you go to your safe house and stand in front of the TV, you are not in a hangout, you can press "G" to play single player video games. When you are in a hangout, you can press "E" to play some video games with your hangout. If your hangout is **Roman, Brucie or Dwayne**, then they will also react to the game you are about to play.
